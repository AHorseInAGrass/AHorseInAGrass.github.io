		      <h2>Instructions</h2>
		      <ul>
		      <li>Please carefully read the article, espeically the colored lines. The first line in the article is its title, and followed by the content of the article. The number at the front of each line is the index of each line (title is not indexed). </li>
		      <li>Please read the selected comment on this article.</li> 
		      <li>Please answer the prepared questions. Under the comment, we have selected a set of lines (include at least one sentence) from the article. Please carefully judge the relevance quality of each selected line to the comment. A selected line is considered to be relevant to the comment if the comment is talking about the same or related topic of the textual content in that line. We further categorize the relevance quality into five levels: <strong>Bad</strong> - totally irrelevant; <strong>Fair</strong> - not quite relevant; <strong>Good</strong> - somehow relevant; <strong>Excellent</strong> - relevant; <strong>Perfect</strong> - exact match. If you are not sure about your judgment in some lines, you can skip them. <br /></li>

Ion beams have unpredictable effects on a surface if used for too long without charge compensation. I was hoping this could be used as a new form of mass spectrometry (the technique that allows us to measure the masses of atoms and molecules). But with requirement to form ions first, there is likely no advantage over existing mass spec designs. Still a very cool development.</font></p><hr />
